i challenge the claim that next token prediction cannot surpass human performance

00:04-00:13
it looks like on the surface it cannot it looks on the surface if you just learn to imitate to

00:13-00:19
predict what people do it means that you can only copy people but there here is a counter argument

00:19-00:25
for why it might not be quite so if your neural net is if your base neural net is smart enough

00:25-00:31
you just ask it like what would what would a person with like great insight and wisdom and

00:31-00:36
capability do maybe such person doesn't exist but there's a pretty good chance that the neural net

00:36-00:43
will be able to extrapolate how such a person should behave do you see what i mean yes although

00:43-00:48
where would it get the sort of insight about what that person would do if not from from the data of

00:48-00:52
regular people because like if you think about it what does it mean to predict the next token well

00:52-00:57
enough what does it mean actually it's actually it's a much it's a deeper question than it seems

00:57-01:07
predicting the next token well means that you understand the underlying reality that led to the

01:07-01:13
creation of that token it's not statistics like it is statistics but what is statistics

01:13-01:21
in order to and to understand those statistics to compress them you need to understand what is it about

01:21-01:26
the world that creates this statistics and so then you say okay well i have all those people what is

01:26-01:31
it about people that creates their behaviors well they have you know they have thoughts and their

01:31-01:38
feelings and they have ideas and they do things in certain ways all of those could be deduced from

01:38-01:46
next token prediction and i'd argue that this should make it possible not indefinitely but to a to a pretty

01:46-01:50
decent degree to say well can you guess what you what you do if you took a person with like this

01:50-01:56
characteristic and that characteristic like such a person doesn't exist but because you're so good

01:56-02:00
at predicting the next token you should still be able to guess what that person would do this hypothetical

02:00-02:06
imaginary person with far greater mental ability than the rest of us
